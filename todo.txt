- Can be reused

// requests
somebody take the requests from the bot events II suggestions and request thread and put them here thanks

FROM HeedicalKing:

Slayer support would be neat. Having team bots that are able to stand on and capture the capture points.
A GUI that allows you to pick bot uniforms, or an event that sets them to a slayer team's uniform.
Bot inventory where they can hold multiple items with events to pick which slot to use, or a free to use AI option.
Bots can use vehicle turrets.
setbottransform (is this already done?)
VCE modify bots (is this already done?)
Bots can open doors  (is this already done?)
Bump. if this is ever made. (directional events http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=204333.0) should be included. 
maybe have an advanced option to set a degree of rotation as well.

FROM Legodude77:

setbotspeed maybe so that we don't have to have custom playertypes?

FROM Mysteroo:

If bot events are redone, I'd like it so that the events and such at least have the same names, or whatever it is 
that needs to be done so that if I loaded a build with the old bot events on it, I wouldn't have to completely
re-event the build.

FROM Fob:

don't let it break down in dedicated servers please, bot events is essential for a good rpg server :(

FROM Counter98:

YES! GUI'S!
I'm tired of running out of event space just to make my guy look like a soldier

// ideas

[0] remote debug reporting - we setup some kind of a system with a bot on it, maybe irc (yes im looking at you elm) and then we can have the betas push reports out to us because people will undoubtedly not send reports back to us
screw them
